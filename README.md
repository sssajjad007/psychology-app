# react-native-psychology-app

The Psychology-app project (which I named Taskyn) is designed to manage Psychoanalytic psychotherapy sessions. It needs a server to run, which I put in a separate repo.

This source code consists of various elements and best practices I learned while going though apps written by various talented developers in the React Native Community ⚡

While this mostly consists of how I organize my projects but can be easily extended to suit any workflow 😄

If you face any issue then feel free to open a issue so we can solve it together 😃

Feel free to leave a ⭐ as motivation if this was useful to you 😄
